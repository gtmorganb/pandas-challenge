This challenge allowed me to analyze the data of a game and purchases made during the game. There were a total of 576 players who made at least one purchase while playing. 

These 576 players purchased a total of 179 unique items and there were 780 purchases total. Of the 576 players, 484 were male, 81 were female, and 11 didn't disclose their gender. 

The highest percentage of players are in the age range of 20-24 with 44.79% of players. The smallest percentage of players are in the age range of over 40 with 2.08% of players. 

The three highest averages spent per person happen in the age groups of 35-39, less than 10, and 20-24 respectively. To me, this data could come from a few things. Kids typically do not understand the value of money and may spend more because of that. People aged 35-39 are typically established in their careers and can afford to spend money on games if they would like to. The reason behind the 20-24 age group could be that it is the largest population of players so there may be more "big spenders" in that group. 

The top four items purchased were Final Critic, Oathbreaker,Fiery Glass Crusader and Persuasion respectively. This must mean these items have a high value in the game. Persuasion and Fiery Glass Crusader did have the same frequency of purchases. 

All of this data and more can be seen by running the Panda code.
